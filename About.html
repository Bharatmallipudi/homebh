            Mahindra & Mahindra was founded as a steel trading company on October 2, 1945, in Ludhiana as Mahindra & Mohammed by brothers Kailash Chandra Mahindra and Jagdish Chandra Mahindra, along with Malik Ghulam Muhammad.[8] Anand Mahindra, the present Chairman of Mahindra Group, is the grandson of Jagdish Chandra Mahindra. In 1948, Ghulam Mohammed decided to move to the newly formed Pakistan.The Mahindras were left with stationary and company stamp that said M&M. They didn't have the financial resources to change the name. Since there were two Mahindra brothers in the business they decided to change the company name to Mahindra & Mahindra .[9]
